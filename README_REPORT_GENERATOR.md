## Files

- `wifi_report_generator.py` - Main report generator class with all components integrated
- `test_report_generator.py` - Test script for the report generator

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- ReportLab 3.6.0+

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install reportlab
```

2. Copy the report generator files to your project directory.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from wifi_report_generator import SecurityReportGenerator

# Create the report generator with your data
report_generator = SecurityReportGenerator(
    audit_data=your_audit_data,
    networks=your_networks_list,
    scan_duration=scan_duration_in_seconds  # Optional
)

# Generate the report
output_path = report_generator.generate_report()

print(f"Report saved to: {output_path}")
```

### Data Format

The report generator expects data in the following format:

#### Networks List

A list of dictionaries, each representing a WiFi network:

```python
networks = [
    {
        "ssid": "Network-Name",
        "bssid": "00:11:22:33:44:55",
        "auth_type": "WPA2-Personal",
        "signal": 85,  # Percentage
        "channel": 6,
        "band": "2.4 GHz"
    },
    # More networks...
]
```

#### Audit Data

A dictionary containing security audit results:

```python
audit_data = {
    "total_networks": len(networks),
    "overall_risk_score": 65,  # 0-100
    "risk_assessment": {
        "high_risk_networks": [
            {
                "ssid": "Vulnerable-Network",
                "score": 15,
                "issues": ["Open network with no encryption"]
            },
            # More high-risk networks...
        ],
        "weak_security_networks": [
            # Networks with moderate security concerns...
        ],
        "strong_security_networks": [
            # Networks with good security...
        ]
    },
    "recommendations": [
        {
            "priority": "high",  # high, medium, or low
            "issue": "Open WiFi Networks",
            "recommendation": "Avoid connecting to open WiFi networks..."
        },
        # More recommendations...
    ]
}
```
